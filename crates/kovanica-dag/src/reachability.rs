//! A reachability oracle: answer "is A an ancestor of B?" without a full
//! per-block `past` set.
//!
//! Today [`Dag`] answers reachability from this oracle rather than from a
//! per-block `past` set stored in full — O(1)/O(fcs) per query but only O(n)
//! memory. This is the standard structure as used by **Kaspa** (see
//! `rusty-kaspa`'s `consensus::processes::reachability`): a **reachability
//! tree** with interval labels, plus a **future-covering set** per block for the
//! DAG edges the tree does not capture.
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! * The **reachability tree** is the selected-parent tree (each block's tree
//!   parent is its GHOSTDAG selected parent; genesis is the root). Every node
//!   carries an interval `[start, end]` such that the subtree of a node is
//!   exactly the contiguous range `[start, end]` and the node itself sits at
//!   `start`. So `X` is a tree-ancestor of (or equal to) `Y` iff
//!   `X.start <= Y.start <= X.end` — an O(1) check.
//!
//! * DAG reachability has edges the tree misses (a block's non-selected
//!   parents). For each block `A` the **future-covering set** `fcs(A)` holds the
//!   tree-roots of `future(A) \ tree_subtree(A)` — the minimal blocks whose tree
//!   subtrees cover the rest of `A`'s future. Then `A` reaches `B` iff `B` is in
//!   `A`'s tree subtree, or `B` is in the tree subtree of some `fcs(A)` member.
//!
//! ## Incremental maintenance (Kaspa reachability / interval reindexing)
//!
//! The oracle is maintained **incrementally**: each [`Dag::insert`] calls
//! [`Reachability::add_block`] to fold in exactly the one new block, never
//! rebuilding from scratch. Because the DAG is append-only and a block's
//! GHOSTDAG selected parent is fixed at insert, the reachability tree only ever
//! gains a **new leaf** under an already-present parent — existing tree edges
//! never move. So `add_block` is Kaspa's two-step `add_block`:
//!
//! 1. **Tree interval allocation with reindexing.** The new block is carved a
//!    sub-interval out of its selected parent's *remaining* capacity (Kaspa
//!    splits the remaining span in half and gives the child the first half, so a
//!    fresh leaf still gets room for its own future subtree — here additionally
//!    **capped at [`CHILD_RESERVE`]** so a wide fan cannot exhaust a large parent
//!    interval after only `log2(width)` children, the interval-reindex
//!    amortisation tuning). When the parent has
//!    no spare capacity, a **reindex** re-lays-out the minimal enclosing subtree
//!    — the lowest ancestor whose interval is roomy enough — distributing that
//!    interval among its children in proportion to subtree size (with slack), so
//!    the exhausted branch gets space again. A reindex touches only that
//!    subtree; the ancestor's own interval is unchanged, so blocks outside it are
//!    untouched. This is Kaspa's interval-reindexing scheme (a simplified
//!    reindex-root policy: pick the lowest sufficiently-large ancestor).
//!
//! 2. **Future-covering-set insertion.** For each block in the new block's
//!    **mergeset** (the selected parent's anticone that the new block merges),
//!    the new block is inserted into that block's future-covering set, kept
//!    minimal and sorted by interval (Kaspa's `insert_to_future_covering_set`:
//!    skip if an existing entry already covers the new block, drop entries the
//!    new block covers, else insert in interval order). Only the *direct*
//!    mergeset needs updating: a deeper ancestor `A` of a merged block already
//!    covers the whole selected-parent subtree via an existing fcs entry that
//!    points into the selected chain, and the new leaf lands inside that same
//!    subtree.
//!
//! [`Reachability::build`] (from-scratch construction over a whole [`Dag`]) is
//! retained: it seeds genesis and is an independent oracle in the differential
//! tests, where the incrementally-maintained oracle is checked, after *every*
//! insert, to give identical query answers to a freshly-built one (see
//! `tests/reachability.rs`). Exact interval numbers differ between the two paths;
//! only the containment answers matter, and those are asserted equal.
