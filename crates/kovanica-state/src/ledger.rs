//! Applying transactions to the UTXO set — the ledger's state-transition rules.
//!
//! Two layers live here:
//!
//! * [`apply_block`] — the strict, atomic state transition for one block's
//!   worth of transactions against a [`UtxoSet`]. It validates every spend
//!   (existence, no double-spend within the block, signature, value
//!   conservation) and the coinbase (issuance ≤ subsidy + fees), then commits.
//!   On *any* error the UTXO set is left untouched.
//! * [`apply_dag`] — the bridge to consensus. It walks
//!   `kovanica_dag::Dag::linearize()` (the deterministic GHOSTDAG total order),
//!   decodes each block's payload into transactions, and applies them in that
//!   order. This is what makes the ledger a *DAG* ledger: parallel blocks are
//!   ordered by GHOSTDAG, and a conflicting spend loses simply because the block
//!   that wins the linearization spent the output first.
//!
//! ## Rules, precisely
//!
//! For a non-coinbase transaction against the current UTXO set:
//! 1. it has at least one input and one output;
//! 2. no outpoint is spent twice within the same transaction;
//! 3. every spent outpoint is currently unspent (exists in the set);
//! 4. every input's signature verifies against the spent output's owner over the
//!    transaction's [`sighash`](crate::tx::Transaction::sighash);
//! 5. every output value is non-zero;
//! 6. outputs do not exceed inputs; the difference is the fee.
//!
//! A block may begin with a single coinbase (input-less) transaction. Regular
//! transactions are applied first, in list order, accumulating fees; then the
//! coinbase's outputs are validated to sum to **at most** `subsidy + fees` and
//! applied last. Because the coinbase is applied last, its outputs are not
//! spendable within the same block (a light-touch maturity rule).
//!
//! ## Deliberate first-slice simplifications
//!
//! * `subsidy` is a single per-block constant passed in, not a halving schedule.
//! * No coinbase maturity beyond "not in the same block"; no fee floor; no tx
//!   size/weight limits.
//! * [`apply_dag`] applies against a fresh state each call (the batch view). The
//!   incremental [`Ledger`] follows the selected tip, so re-orgs above the
//!   finality point are implicit (no revert), and [`Ledger::with_finality`] prunes
//!   the stored state of final blocks and rejects blocks built on final history.
//!   Pruning is of the per-block *state* only; the DAG itself is still append-only.
