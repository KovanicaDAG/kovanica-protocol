## 1. What this project is

**kovanica-protocol** is a **DAG-based distributed ledger** — a high-throughput,
parallel-block cryptocurrency/ledger protocol built on a **Directed Acyclic Graph**
(BlockDAG) rather than a single linear chain. The name *kovanica* is
Serbo-Croatian for "coin / mint." Blocks reference **multiple parents**, so many
blocks can be produced in parallel and later merged, which is what enables high
block rates (BPS).

The consensus core follows **GHOSTDAG** (Sompolinsky, Wyborski & Zohar — the
protocol behind Kaspa, a refinement of PHANTOM). Related systems in the design
space, for reference when extending consensus: IOTA Tangle, Hedera Hashgraph,
Fantom Lachesis/Sonic, Avalanche Snow family, Conflux, OHIE, and the DAG-BFT
mempool/ordering line (Narwhal–Tusk, Bullshark, Mysticeti, Sailfish). When
implementing a mechanism from any of these, **name it** in comments so reviewers
can check it against the paper.

## 2. Core domain concepts (shared vocabulary)

Keep these terms precise and consistent across code, comments, and docs:

- **DAG / BlockDAG** — the ledger is a directed acyclic graph; a block references
  **multiple parents/tips**, enabling parallel block creation.
- **Tip** — a block with no children yet; new blocks reference current tips.
- **Past / ancestors** — all blocks reachable by following parent edges.
- **Anticone** — blocks neither ancestor nor descendant of a given block ("parallel").
- **Selected parent** — the parent with the heaviest blue work; forms the chain backbone.
- **Mergeset** — the blocks a new block merges in: `past(B) \ (past(sp) ∪ {sp})`.
- **Blue set / red set** — the well-connected honest cluster (blue) vs. blocks left
  too far to the side (red), decided by the **k-cluster rule**.
- **k parameter** — max tolerated *blue anticone size*: every blue block may have at
  most `k` blue blocks in its anticone. Larger `k` tolerates higher latency/BPS at a
  wider security margin.
- **Blue score / blue work** — size / total work of a block's blue set; drives chain
  selection and ordering.
- **Partial order → total order (linearization)** — consensus deterministically
  linearizes the DAG so every honest node agrees on one sequence.

Not built yet (**TODO**): VRF and beyond. Update this tree when you add them.

### Deliberate first-slice simplifications (do not mistake for the final design)

- **Reachability** is answered by the interval-tree + future-covering-set oracle
  (`reachability::Reachability`): the selected-parent tree carries DFS interval
  labels and each block a future-covering set for the non-tree edges. This **is**
  the `Dag`'s backing — the per-block `past` sets are gone; each block keeps only
  its `past_size` (the ancestor *count*, all the topological sort key needs), and
  the mergeset is recomputed by a `sp`-bounded backward walk over parent edges
  (`Dag::mergeset_ordered`). The oracle is maintained **incrementally**:
  `Dag::insert` calls `Reachability::add_block` to fold in just the one new block
  — the **Kaspa reachability** scheme (interval allocation with **reindexing** of
  the minimal enclosing subtree, plus incremental future-covering-set insertion
  over the block's mergeset) — never rebuilding from scratch. Because the DAG is
  append-only and each block's selected parent is fixed at insert, the new block
  is always a fresh tree **leaf**, so existing tree edges never move. The
  from-scratch `Reachability::build` is kept to seed genesis and as an independent
  test oracle. Correctness is guarded by a differential test against an
  independent naive parent-walk, an "incremental oracle == freshly-built oracle
  after every insert" test, reindex-stressing scenarios (long chains, wide fans,
  deep+wide mixes), and the whole consensus/ledger suite (unchanged by the
  cutover). Interval **reindexing amortisation** is now tuned: a `CHILD_RESERVE`
  cap on each allocated child interval keeps a wide fan reindex-free (previously
  `O(width^2)` reindex work) — an interval-numbering-only change guarded by the
  correctness-parity + reindex-metric tests. Still open: the DAG-level
  (`past`-set) pruning the oracle unlocks. See `dag.rs` and `reachability.rs`
  module docs.
- **In-memory working state**, with **replay-log persistence**: `Dag`/`Ledger`
  `write_snapshot`/`read_snapshot` serialise only `k`, the subsidy, and the blocks
  in topological order; loading replays inserts so all derived state (the
  reachability oracle, colouring, per-block UTXO state) is recomputed, never
  trusted from disk. There
  is no incremental on-disk store or mmap yet — a snapshot is written/read whole.
- **Linearization** is the recursive GHOSTDAG order:
  `order(B) = order(selected_parent(B)) ++ mergeset_order(B) ++ [B]`, unrolled over
  the selected chain and closed with the selected tip's anticone (the virtual
  block's mergeset). The selected chain is a subsequence and each merged block
  sits directly before its merger. Mergeset order within a block is a deterministic
  topological sort by `(past_size, id)` — a valid GHOSTDAG-spirit order, not Kaspa's
  exact blue-work mergeset tiebreak. See `ordering.rs` module docs.
- **State (`kovanica-state`)** applies transactions in GHOSTDAG order. Two views:
  `apply_dag` folds a finished DAG from scratch; `Ledger` maintains each block's
  view state incrementally from its selected parent (per-block state stored in
  full — an O(n²) memory trade-off; the DAG's own `past` sets have since been
  replaced by the reachability oracle, but the per-block UTXO state has not). A
  halving schedule ([`HalvingSchedule`]) controls per-block subsidy; coinbase
  maturity is only "not spendable in the same block"; TX size/weight limits are
  enforced via [`MAX_TX_SIZE`], [`MAX_BLOCK_PAYLOAD_SIZE`], [`MAX_TXS_PER_BLOCK`].
  `Ledger::with_finality` prunes the per-block state of final blocks (more than
  `finality_depth` blue score below the tip) and rejects blocks built on final
  history; re-orgs above the finality point are implicit (`ledger_state` follows
  the selected tip, no revert). Pruning is of the per-block *state* only — the
  DAG stays append-only (DAG/`past`-set pruning waits on the reachability oracle).
  See `ledger.rs` module docs.
- **Insert-time validation** now has both layers. `Dag::with_validator` +
  `TxStructureValidator` reject malformed/structurally-invalid blocks; `Ledger`
  additionally runs the **stateful** rules (input existence, signatures, value
  conservation, coinbase amount) against a block's view state before it enters the
  DAG (via `Dag::preview`), so a block invalid in its own view is rejected at
  insert. Two *parallel* blocks that spend the same output are each valid in their
  own view and both admitted; their conflict resolves only in a merger's view.
- **Proof-of-work** is now real, and opt-in. `Block` carries a `nonce` (in the
  canonical id encoding); `pow::meets_target(id, work)` is the
  Nakamoto/Bitcoin-style hash-target rule — the id read as a big-endian 256-bit
  integer `H` must satisfy `H * work < 2^256`, so `work` is the *expected number
  of hashes* to find the block (a fraction `1/work` pass) and heavier blocks are
  genuinely harder, making blue work measure real spent hash power. The 256×128
  check is dependency-free limb arithmetic. `Dag::set_proof_of_work(true)` opts a
  DAG into **enforcement**: `Dag::insert` then rejects any non-genesis block whose
  id does not meet its target (`DagError::InsufficientProofOfWork`); genesis is
  exempt. `pow::mine` searches the nonce; `Ledger::set_proof_of_work` threads the
  switch through the state layer and the node mines produced blocks when it is on.
  **Off by default**, so a DAG that does not opt in accepts any nonce, exactly as
  before. PoW and difficulty are independent, composable switches (with both on,
  difficulty pins `work` and PoW requires the block to be mined to it).
- **Difficulty** now has both the algorithm and consensus enforcement. `Block`
  carries a `timestamp_ms` (in the canonical id encoding); `work` is caller-set
  *unless* difficulty is enabled.
  `difficulty::Retarget::next_work` is the retargeting *algorithm*;
  `Dag::set_difficulty(retarget)` opts a DAG into **enforcement**, after which
  `Dag::insert` requires every non-genesis block's `work` to equal
  `Dag::next_work_target(parents)` (the retarget over the last `window + 1` blocks
  of the selected-parent chain — a pure function of the DAG) and its timestamp not
  to precede any parent's. Genesis is exempt. `Ledger::set_difficulty` threads the
  same switch through the state layer, and the node mines produced blocks to
  `next_work_target` when it is set. Enforcement is **opt-in**, so a DAG built
  without it accepts any `work`, exactly as before. The wall-clock "not too far
  in the future" bound on timestamps is *not* here — that is node policy, not a
  pure function of the DAG. It lives in `kovanica-node` (`Node::receive_block`
  rejects a block whose `timestamp_ms` exceeds the node's clock by more than
  `MAX_FUTURE_DRIFT_MS` = 2h); the node's clock is injectable (`Node::set_now_ms`)
  so production timestamps and the bound are deterministic in tests, and produced
  blocks now stamp wall-clock now clamped monotone above their parents.

## 4. Build, test & run

Rust workspace (edition 2021, `rust-version` 1.75). From the repo root:

- **Build:** `cargo build`
- **Test (all: unit + integration + doctests):** `cargo test`
- **Single test:** `cargo test <name>` (e.g. `cargo test adversarial_wide_fork`)
- **Lint:** `cargo clippy --all-targets` (keep it warning-clean)
- **Format:** `cargo fmt` (CI-style check: `cargo fmt --check`)
- **Run the node:** `cargo run -p kovanica-node -- demo` (scripted end-to-end
  scenario) or `cargo run -p kovanica-node` (a `serve` REPL reading commands from
  stdin; try `help`).

`unsafe` code is **forbidden** crate-wide (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` via
`[lints.rust]`). `kovanica-dag`/`kovanica-state` are libraries; `kovanica-node`
is a library plus a binary (`serve`/`demo`).

## 5. Engineering conventions

- **Consensus correctness is paramount.** Any change to selected-parent choice,
  mergeset, k-cluster colouring, blue score/work, or linearization can break safety
  (double-spend) or liveness. Such changes require: a written rationale naming the
  protocol semantics being followed, and **deterministic + adversarial tests**
  (Byzantine/equivocating parents, wide forks beyond `k`, tie-breaks, partitions).
- **Determinism.** Consensus output must be a pure function of the DAG — identical on
  every node. Never let HashMap iteration order, wall-clock time, or unstable sorts
  affect a consensus result. (The colouring iterates a HashMap but its *outcome* is
  order-independent; preserve that property.)
- **Tie-breaks** fall back to `BlockId` byte order — keep it that way for determinism.
- **Tests:** prefer property/invariant and adversarial tests for graph/consensus code.
  The k-cluster invariant (`blue_anticone_size <= k` for every blue block) is a good
  general assertion — see `tests/consensus.rs`.
- **Style:** match surrounding code; document *why*. Keep consensus-affecting changes
  in focused commits.

## 6. Git workflow

- **Never commit to the default branch directly.** Develop on a feature branch and
  open a **draft PR**.
- **Branch naming:** short, kebab-case, scoped — `consensus/…`, `dag/…`, `ledger/…`,
  or `claude/<topic>` for assistant-driven work.
- **Commits:** clear, imperative subject lines describing *why*. Run `cargo fmt`,
  `cargo clippy --all-targets`, and `cargo test` before pushing.
- **Push:** `git push -u origin <branch-name>`; open a PR if none exists for the branch.

## 7. For AI assistants — working notes

- This file is the **source of truth for conventions**; when reality and this file
  disagree, fix one or the other in the same PR — don't silently diverge.
- **Do not invent** APIs, module paths, or commands. If a section here is TODO, say so
  rather than fabricating specifics.
- When reasoning about consensus, cite the concrete reference system (GHOSTDAG,
  Bullshark, Avalanche, …) so the design stays auditable.
- Before claiming tests/builds pass, actually run them and report real output.

## Roadmap

Work is organised in **stages**. Stage 0 is shipped history (kept for
context); Stages 1–3 are the live plan, in order. Each stage should end
testable and deployable on its own — do not start a stage while the
previous one has open items without a written reason.

### Stage 0 — Shipped: single-chain → BlockDAG testnet

Everything below is deployed on `kovanica-testnet` (seed:
`seed.kovanica.online:9000`, explorer: `explorer.kovanica.online`).
CI gates every push (`fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`,
`cargo test`) before deploy is allowed to run.

- [x] Transactions + a UTXO state layer; apply state in linearized order (`kovanica-state`).
- [x] Signatures (ed25519) for spend authorisation.
- [x] Block-level validation at insert time: context-free structural validation
      (`BlockValidator` hook + `TxStructureValidator`) and stateful (UTXO-aware)
      validation (`Ledger` + `Dag::preview`).
- [x] Recursive GHOSTDAG linearization (`order(B) = order(sp) ++ mergeset ++ [B]`),
      the ordering per-block UTXO state composes along.
- [x] Per-block UTXO state built incrementally from each block's selected parent
      (`Ledger`), matching `apply_dag`; enables stateful validation at insert.
- [x] Finality-depth pruning + re-orgs (`Ledger::with_finality`): prune the
      per-block state of final blocks, reject blocks built on final history, and
      follow the selected tip (implicit re-org, no revert).
- [x] Persistence: replay-log snapshots of the DAG and ledger
      (`Dag`/`Ledger` `write_snapshot`/`read_snapshot`) — state recomputed on load.
- [x] Reachability oracle (`reachability::Reachability`): interval-tree +
      future-covering sets, now the `Dag`'s backing for ancestor queries and
      mergeset computation. The per-block `past` sets are dropped (each block keeps
      only `past_size`); mergeset is a selected-parent-bounded backward walk.
- [x] Incremental reachability maintenance (Kaspa reachability / interval
      **reindexing**): `Dag::insert` folds in just the one new block via
      `Reachability::add_block` (tree-interval allocation, subtree reindexing on
      capacity exhaustion, future-covering-set insertion over the mergeset)
      instead of rebuilding the oracle from scratch each insert. Behaviour-
      preserving — guarded by an "incremental == freshly-built after every insert"
      differential test plus reindex-stressing scenarios. Still open: the DAG-level
      `past`-set / interval-reindex pruning this unlocks.
- [x] Incremental / streaming on-disk store (`LedgerStore`): append-only replay
      log; loading recomputes state. Whole-file snapshots remain for portable
      backups.
- [x] Runnable node binary + a line RPC over the ledger (`kovanica-node`:
      `serve`/`demo`, snapshot-backed).
- [x] Mempool + block production (`pool`/`produce`), and multi-node block
      dissemination — in-process `gossip` and a one-shot TCP pull sync — with
      nodes converging on the same DAG (conflicts resolved identically).
- [x] Continuous in-process p2p gossip (`p2p::Mesh`): peer discovery via hello
      advertisements, a delayed relay loop, tx (not just block) dissemination,
      and mempool eviction of txs whose inputs are gone from the selected-tip
      UTXO view.
- [x] Long-lived TCP relay (`relay::RelaySession`): the same hello/block/tx
      envelopes as the in-process mesh, framed on a persistent socket. WebSocket
      sessions implemented in `explorer.rs` (`/ws` endpoint).
- [x] Difficulty adjustment for `work`: the retargeting algorithm
      (`difficulty::Retarget::next_work`) plus **consensus enforcement**. `Block`
      now carries a `timestamp_ms`; `Dag::set_difficulty` opts a DAG into
      validating each block's `work` against `Dag::next_work_target` (the retarget
      over the selected-parent chain — a pure function of the DAG) and its
      timestamp against its parents'. Threaded through `Ledger::set_difficulty` and
      the node's miner.
- [x] Wall-clock future-time bound on block timestamps (**node policy**, not
      pure-DAG): `Node::receive_block` rejects a block whose `timestamp_ms` is more
      than `MAX_FUTURE_DRIFT_MS` (2h) ahead of the node's clock. The clock is
      injectable (`Node::set_now_ms`) for deterministic tests; produced blocks
      stamp wall-clock now clamped monotone above their parents
      (`crates/kovanica-node/tests/timestamps.rs`).
- [x] Real proof-of-work (`kovanica-dag::pow`): `Block` carries a `nonce`, and
      `pow::meets_target` is the Nakamoto hash-target rule (`H * work < 2^256`,
      dependency-free 256×128 limb arithmetic), so `work` = expected hashes and
      blue work measures spent hash power. `Dag::set_proof_of_work(true)` opts a
      DAG into enforcement (`Dag::insert` → `InsufficientProofOfWork`; genesis
      exempt); `pow::mine` searches the nonce; threaded through
      `Ledger::set_proof_of_work` and the node's miner. Opt-in and composable with
      difficulty (`crates/kovanica-dag/tests/pow.rs`).
- [x] Halving schedule (`HalvingSchedule` in `ledger.rs`, `Node::issuance_at()` in `node.rs`)
- [x] TX size limits (`MAX_TX_SIZE`, `MAX_BLOCK_PAYLOAD_SIZE`, `MAX_TXS_PER_BLOCK` in `validation.rs`)
- [x] WebSocket explorer (`/ws` endpoint in `explorer.rs`, `WsMsg` types)
- [x] Live frontend WS client/hooks (`kovanica-web/src/lib/api/client.ts`: `wsClient`, `useWsMessage`, `useWsState`, `useWsBlocks`, `useWsTxs`)
- [x] CORS proxy for live explorer (`/proxy` path on explorer.kovanica.online)
- [x] Human addresses (`Address::to_kvnc`/`parse`, `kvnc…dag` base58 wrap over the
      32 key bytes; parse also accepts 64-hex) — reconciled from the testnet
      deployment snapshot so the canonical repo and deployed nodes share one
      address rendering (`crates/kovanica-state/src/keys.rs`).
- [x] Framed bidirectional TCP sync: `pull_blocks_timeout` reads a framed dump,
      applies it, and writes its own pre-apply snapshot back; `serve_exchange`
      mirrors that on the seed side (old one-way peers still work — reply
      write failures are ignored). Replaces EOF-delimited one-shot pulls on
      the explorer P2P loop, which now binds dual-stack listeners
      (`0.0.0.0:P` + `[::]:P`) and exchanges instead of only serving.
- [x] Multi-input transfers in `Node::prepare_transfer` (UTXOs accumulated
      largest-first until they cover amount + fee; one signature attached to
      every input) — no more spurious `InsufficientFunds` when the balance is
      spread across many coinbases.
- [x] TAP micro-faucet on the explorer (`POST /api/tap`, `KOVANICA_TAP=0|1`,
      default on): 0.01 KVNC per request, 40/day per address, persisted in
      `data/taps.txt`; plus `KOVANICA_MINE_SECS` for the public mine interval.
      Explorer addresses accept `kvnc…dag` or hex everywhere.
- [x] CI gate + dual-stack P2P: every push runs `fmt --check`,
      `clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test` before deploy may start (deploy job
      additionally armed via a `DEPLOY_ENABLED` repo variable); the seed's
      `[::]:P` listener binds with `IPV6_V6ONLY` so v4 and v6 coexist.

### Stage 1 — Operations hardening

Goal: make the running testnet trustworthy to operate day-to-day. No
consensus changes.

- [x] Arm auto-deploy: `VPS_HOST` / `VPS_USERNAME` / `VPS_PRIVATE_KEY`
      secrets + `DEPLOY_ENABLED=true`; verified end-to-end (merge → tests →
      SSH build on the VPS → pm2 restart; deploy exports cargo/pm2 PATH for
      the non-interactive shell).
- [x] Seed ops runbook: `OPERATIONS.md` — backup/restore of `data/`,
      restart drill, post-deploy checks (`api/head`, both listeners,
      peer exchange), log locations, network-marker semantics.
- [x] Web proxy question resolved: kovanica-web reaches the explorer
      **server-side** (`src/lib/api/upstream.server.ts`), so there is no
      cross-origin problem to solve; the cors-proxy worker and the
      `/proxy` path are dropped (kept only as an unused local folder).
      Local kovanica-web/kovanica-node clones are stale snapshots of the
      GitHub repos — GitHub is authoritative for those two.
- [x] Show `kvnc…dag` addresses in the web wallet UI — shipped upstream
      (kovanica-web `bcef5f0`: wallet displays kvnc, send accepts hex or
      kvnc).

### Stage 2 — Scale & persistence

Goal: survive growth. Sync that does not re-download the world; memory
and disk that do not grow forever.

- [x] Headers-first sync: peers exchange tips/headers first, then fetch
      block bodies by hash on demand — replaces whole-dump exchange as the
      default catch-up path.
- [x] DAG-level pruning behind the reachability oracle (the item its
      incremental maintenance unlocked): bounded ancestor state, append-only
      DAG with prunable payloads.
      - `Block.payload` is now `Option<Vec<u8>>`; `None` means pruned
      - `Dag::set_payload_pruning_depth(depth)` evicts payloads of blocks
        more than `depth` blue score below the selected tip
      - `Dag::prune_old_payloads()` called automatically on insert
      - Reachability queries (`is_ancestor`, mergeset, GHOSTDAG colouring,
        linearization) work correctly on pruned blocks — the oracle never
        inspects payloads
      - Snapshots encode pruned blocks with empty payload; load reconstructs
        `payload = None`
      - `Ledger::with_payload_pruning()` and `Ledger::with_finality_and_payload_pruning()`
        thread the depth through the state layer
      - `Node::genesis_with_finality()` and `Node::set_payload_pruning_depth()`
        expose it at the node layer
      - `Node::receive_block` rejects blocks whose selected parent has a
        pruned payload (mirrors finality check but uses payload pruning depth)
- [x] Finality checkpointing: persist the UTXO set at finality depth so a
      restart replays only post-checkpoint blocks instead of all history.
      - `Ledger::write_checkpoint()` / `read_checkpoint()` serialise the UTXO
        set at the finality boundary plus the tip segment (non-final blocks).
      - `LedgerStore::create_checkpoint()` / `open_checkpoint()` for file I/O.
      - `Node::save_checkpoint()` / `load_checkpoint()` and RPC commands
        `checkpoint` / `load_checkpoint` for node-level operations.
      - Checkpoint format v2 stores checkpoint block height for correct subsidy
        calculation on restore. The checkpoint block is included in the tip
        segment and reconstructed with its original ID via `Block::new_pruned`.
      - Restored ledger applies checkpoint UTXO set directly and replays only
        the tip segment, avoiding full history replay.
- [x] Reachability interval-reindex amortisation tuning (open from Stage 0):
      cap each freshly-allocated child interval at `CHILD_RESERVE` so a wide fan
      no longer exhausts its parent's interval every ~log2(width) children —
      turning the old `O(width^2)` reindex work for a broad fan into zero
      reindexes below the ~8M-child threshold (chains/deep-wide unchanged).
      Interval-numbering-only, so every reachability answer is identical;
      `Dag::reachability_reindex_metrics()` exposes the reindex counters the
      amortisation tests assert on.

### Stage 3 — Protocol evolution

Goal: consensus-level features. Each item needs a written rationale
naming the reference protocol (GHOSTDAG paper, Kaspa, PHANTOM §…) plus
deterministic + adversarial tests per the conventions above.

- [x] VRF for leader selection / a randomness beacon (the standing TODO).
  - `kovanica-dag::vrf`: ECVRF over Ristretto255 (Ed25519 curve), IRTF CFRG draft
  - `vrf_prove`/`vrf_verify`: deterministic VRF with Schnorr-style proof `(Γ, c, s)`
  - Block fields: `vrf_public_key`, `vrf_proof`, `vrf_output` (Option for backward compat)
  - `Dag::set_vrf(threshold)`: consensus-enforced leader eligibility
  - VRF input = `H(tip1 || tip2 || ...)` from parent tips
  - Eligibility: `VRF_output.as_u64() < threshold`; `u64::MAX` = all eligible (randomness beacon)
  - Composes with PoW + difficulty (independent opt-in switches)
  - Snapshot format v5 includes VRF fields
  - Tests: eligibility, invalid proof, wrong key, missing fields, composes with PoW, beacon
- [x] P2P hardening: per-peer rate limits on framed reads, duplicate-block
      suppression metrics, peer scoring/banning.
  - `kovanica-node::p2p_hardening`: configurable hardening parameters
  - Rate limiting: max bytes/messages per peer per time window
  - Duplicate suppression: track known blocks/txs per peer, penalize resends
  - Peer scoring: reward valid blocks/txs (+1), penalize duplicates (-5/-2), heavy penalty for invalid (-20/-10)
  - Auto-ban when score <= threshold (default -50); manual ban/unban API
  - Integration: rate limits checked on `Mesh::enqueue`, duplicates checked on `Mesh::deliver`
  - Stats: `Mesh::peer_stats` / `all_peer_stats` for monitoring
  - Tests: rate limit enforcement, duplicate penalties, ban prevents relay, stats
- [x] Mempool policy upgrades: orphan-tx handling, fee-based eviction order.
  - `kovanica-node::mempool_v2`: enhanced mempool with orphan pool and fee-based eviction
  - Orphan pool: txs with missing inputs held separately, auto-promoted when block adds inputs
  - Fee-based eviction: lowest fee-rate txs evicted first when capacity exceeded
  - Capacity limits: configurable max tx count (default 100k) and max bytes (default 100MB)
  - Minimum fee rate enforcement (default 1 atom/byte)
  - Orphan auto-expiry after configurable block age (default 100 blocks)
  - Backward-compatible `Mempool` wrapper for existing code
  - Tests: orphan promotion, fee ordering, capacity eviction, min fee rate

### Beyond

Ideas parked until Stages 1–3 close: light clients / SPV-style proofs over
the linearized chain, multi-seed discovery (DNS seeds / DHT), and anything
the testnet teaches us it needs.
